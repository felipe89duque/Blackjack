- There is only one player (either you OR a trained agent).
- The game is played with D decks of Poker (52 cards per deck: 2-10 plus
  J/Q/K/A per suit).
- You choose the number of decks D (infinite decks is a possibility). 
- The value of each card is its number. J, Q and K have all a value of 10.
- Aces have a value of 11 unless the hand sum goes over 21, then its
  value is of 1.
- The game lasts until all cards are used.
- The aim of the game is to maximize the accumulated score. This is the addition
  of the score of all hands played.
- The score of a hand is: the square of the hand sum, if this is lower or equal
  to 21; 0 if the hand sum goes over 21... In other words, try to get as close
  to 21 as possible without passing it.
- Whenever a new card is dealt, its value is added to the hand sum.
- When a card is dealt, there are two possible actions to choose from: Hit (h)
  or Stick (s). Hit means that a new card will be dealt, Stick means that the
  hand will end at the current hand sum.\n\n''')

    print('''
At the main menu, choose whether you want to play blackjack, or see how a
reinforcement learning (RL) trained agent plays by itself. In any case, you then
must choose the number of decks of cards to play with. To play with infinitely
many cards, choose '0' as the number of decks (You may want to play in this
setting as the 'easy' version, as the likelyhood of any card being dealt does
not change over time). 

At this point, an episode of blackjack will start. If you chose to see the
agent play, enjoy. If you chose to play yourself, bare in mind that after each
card deal you must select the next action (hit or stick). 
- For Hit, enter the character 'h' followed by 'Enter'.
- For Stick, enter the character 's' followed bu 'Enter'.

The program can be forced to stop at any point by pressing Ctrl+C.
