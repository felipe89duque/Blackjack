abstract = {In recent years, quantum phase transitions have attracted the interest of both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behaviour of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions is boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed at bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview on a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.},

abstract = {In stochastic systems, numerically sampling the relevant trajectories for the estimation of the large deviation statistics of time-extensive observables requires overcoming their exponential (in space and time) scarcity. The optimal way to access these rare events is by means of an auxiliary dynamics obtained from the original one through the so-called “generalised Doob transformation”. While this optimal dynamics is guaranteed to exist its use is often impractical, as to define it requires the often impossible task of diagonalising a (tilted) dynamical generator. While approximate schemes have been devised to overcome this issue they are difficult to automate as they tend to require knowledge of the systems under study. Here we address this problem from the perspective of deep learning. We devise an iterative semi-supervised learning scheme which converges to the optimal or Doob dynamics with the clear advantage of requiring no prior knowledge of the system. We test our method in a paradigmatic statistical mechanics model with non-trivial dynamical fluctuations, the fully packed classical dimer model on the square lattice, showing that it compares favourably with more traditional approaches. We discuss broader implications of our results for the study of rare dynamical trajectories.},

These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic ``N{\'{e}}el ordered'' states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as ``local functions'' of states of a special kind, so-called ``purely generated states,'' which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range VBS interactions. We show that all these generalized VBS models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.},

abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile ‘adaptive time-dependent DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

abstract = {Originally developed in the context of condensed-matter physics and based on renormalization group ideas, tensor networks have been revived thanks to quantum information theory and the progress in understanding the role of entanglement in quantum many-body systems. Moreover, tensor network states have turned out to play a key role in other scientific disciplines. In this context, here I provide an overview of the basic concepts and key developments in the field. I briefly discuss the most important tensor network structures and algorithms, together with an outline of advances related to global and gauge symmetries, fermions, topological order, classification of phases, entanglement Hamiltonians, holografic duality, artificial intelligence, the 2D Hubbard model, 2D quantum antiferromagnets, conformal field theory, quantum chemistry, disordered systems and many-body localization.},

The application of TNs to ML, however, has mostly focused on supervised and unsupervised learning. Yet, with their direct connection to hidden Markov chains, TNs are also naturally suited to Markov decision processes (MDPs) which provide the foundation for reinforcement learning (RL). Here we introduce a general TN formulation of finite, episodic and discrete MDPs. We show how this formulation allows us to exploit algorithms developed for TNs for policy optimisation, the key aim of RL. As an application we consider the issue - formulated as an RL problem - of finding a stochastic evolution that satisfies specific dynamical conditions, using the simple example of random walk excursions as an illustration.},

In particular, we show that the generalised Doob transform which maps a conditioned process to an equivalent `auxiliary' or `driven' process (one where the same conditioned set of trajectories is generated by a proper stochastic dynamics) is just a gauge transformation of the corresponding cMPS.

We recover with this framework known results about the asymptotic efficiency of the exponential tilting and obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions for a general change of process to be asymptotically efficient. This allows us to construct new examples of efficient estimators for sample means of random variables that do not have the exponential tilting form. Other examples involving Markov chains and diffusions are presented to illustrate our results.},

abstract = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are required are strategies to “make rare events typical” so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent.

We show that for the doped Hubbard model in the strongly correlated regime (U/t=8,n=0.875) the iPEPS yields lower variational energies than state-of-the-art variational methods in the large two-dimensional limit, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the method. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of the energy in the exact infinite-D limit we introduce and test an extrapolation technique based on a truncation error computed in the iPEPS imaginary time evolution algorithm. The extrapolated energies are compared with accurate quantum Monte Carlo results at half-filling and with various other methods in the doped, strongly correlated regime.},

We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle.

As suggested by its name, the LCTMRG is a modification of the corner-transfer-matrix DMRG, adjusted by an additional causality argument. As an example, two reaction–diffusion models, the diffusion–annihilation process and the branch–fusion process are studied and compared with exact data and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the capability and accuracy of the new method. The number of possible Trotter steps of more than 105 shows a considerable improvement on the old stochastic TMRG algorithm.},

Frenesy is the time-symmetric part of the path-space action with respect to a reference process. It collects the variable quiescence and dynamical activity as function of the system's trajectory, and as has been introduced under different forms in studies of nonequilibria. We discuss its various realizations for physically inspired Markov jump and diffusion processes and why it matters a good deal for nonequilibrium physics. This review then serves also as an introduction to the exploration of frenetic contributions in nonequilibrium phenomena.},

Recent works have shown that tensor network methods are well suited to compute the relevant leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors accurately. However, the efficient generation of the corresponding rare trajectories is a harder task. Here we show how to exploit the MPS approximation of the dominant eigenvector to implement an efficient sampling scheme which closely resembles the optimal (so-called "Doob") dynamics that realises the rare events. We demonstrate our approach on three well-studied lattice models, the Fredrickson-Andersen and East kinetically constrained models (KCMs), and the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP). We discuss how to generalise our approach to higher dimensions.},

abstract = {We describe quantum many--body systems in terms of projected entangled--pair states, which naturally extend matrix product states to two and more dimensions. We present an algorithm to determine correlation functions in an efficient way. We use this result to build powerful numerical simulation techniques to describe the ground state, finite temperature, and evolution of spin systems in two and higher dimensions.},

@article{Jack2020b,
abstract = {We analyse a first-order dynamical phase transition that takes place in the Fredrickson–Andersen (FA) model. We construct a two-dimensional spin system whose thermodynamic properties reproduce the dynamical large deviations of the FA model and we analyse this system numerically, comparing our results with finite-size scaling theory. This allows us to rationalise recent results for the FA model, including the exponential divergence of its susceptibility at phase coexistence. We also discuss a simple interfacial model that reproduces quantitatively the behaviour of the FA model at coexistence.},
